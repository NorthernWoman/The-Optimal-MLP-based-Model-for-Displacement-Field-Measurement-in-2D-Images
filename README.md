# The Optimal MLP based Model for Displacement Field Measurement in 2D Images


This repository contains materials from the study D.Mangileva "The optimal mlp-based model for displacement field measurement in 2d images and its application perspective"
(https://doi.org/10.1145/3663976.3664021)

To run on a computer, use PyTorch version >= 1.3.

The folders contain noisy and noise‑free images with displacement fields of different frequencies. 

- In line 143, specify the folder name where model results and weights will be saved.
- In lines 145–146, insert the path to the images.

The ready‑to‑use utilities were taken from the work: Li, Nianyi, et al. "Unsupervised non-rigid image distortion removal via grid deformation." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021. https://github.com/Nianyi-Li/unsupervised-NDIR.git
